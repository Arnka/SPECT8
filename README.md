Since I didnâ€™t have experience with JavaScript frameworks, Vue.js was perfect from the start. Detailed Vue.js documentation helped me a lot. With basic knowledge of HTML and JavaScript I was able to take advantage of Vue.js in no time thanks to step by step guides.

For this challenge, I worked 4 hours on average every day.

"Hardest" part of the challenge 

The parts that took most of my time were Login/Signup pages. One of the issues was creating a secure app, that will not allow user to access data through the path without proper authentication. Generally the biggest problem I had in this challenge was prioritizing tasks. In the very beginning I was overthinking, so I started the project by implementing the authentication. The problem with this was, that the login screen was the most time consuming part. Being beginner, I felt overwhelmed with all the new info.
